            i currently (as of august 2024) work on keurig dr pepper's product design team. i mostly do UI/UX focused stuff with our brewers (not super involved in the dr pepper part).
            i perform tests on existing brewer models, analyze/compile data to understand user journeys, and recommend design improvements for new, upcoming brewers.

           my last job was at <a href="https://tulip.co" target=_blank>tulip interfaces</a> as a engineering co-op. i did a little bit of everything,
            working with tech partners to create content for them, and get really comfortable with the tulip ecosystem. also helped develop, set-up,
            and support the creation of demos for our various tech conferences, such as <a>href-"https://tulip.co/ebooks/40-hour-pop-up-factory-2023/" target="_blank>this</a>,
            thing i built for it.

            my first co-op was at a place called <a>href="https://www.serestherapeutics.com" target="_blank"> seres therapetics</a> as a
            facilities and automation engineer. my coop was extended to a part-time position so i ended up working there for a year. it was cool,
            i was involved in a lot of biotech stuff that (at the time) was way over my head, and got to be there for their first FDA drug approval.

               i like to write satire. for four glorious years i was involved in the husky husky, northeastern's student
               run satire paper. i have a unique perspective on all matters and am probably the most qualified person on
               earth to write news.
