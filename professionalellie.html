                <h3>KEURIG DR PEPPER</h3>
                <p>My last co-op was on Keurig Dr Pepper's product design team (July 24-Dec 24). I did UI/UX focused stuff with our brewers (not super involved in the Dr Pepper part).</p>
                <p>I performed tests on existing brewer models, analyzed/compiled data to understand user journeys, and recommended design improvements for new, upcoming brewers.</p>
                <p>One project I worked on was developing a UI database of all exisitng Keurig brewers. This was a cross-team project where
                  I performed a sweep of our existing brewer models, categorized them, and collaborated with our design, research, and engineering teams to refine the resource.

                <h3>TULIP INTERFACES</h3>
                <p>My last job was at <a href="https://tulip.co" target="_blank">Tulip Interfaces</a> as an engineering co-op. I did a little bit of everything, working with tech partners to create content for them, and got really comfortable with the Tulip ecosystem.</p>
                <p>I also helped develop, set-up, and support the creation of demos for our various tech conferences, such as <a href="https://tulip.co/ebooks/40-hour-pop-up-factory-2023/" target="_blank">the Digital Factory</a>.</p>

                <p>To see an example of a project I worked on, check out <a href="https://library.tulip.co/videos/onshape-integration-example">this</a> demo I built to
                  showcase Tulip's functionality with the <a href="https://www.onshape.com/en/">Onshape</a> API.

                <h3>SERES THERAPEUTICS</h3>
                <p>My first co-op was at <a href="https://www.serestherapeutics.com" target="_blank">Seres Therapeutics</a> as a validation and automation engineer. This was extended to a part-time position so I ended up working there for a year.</p>
                <p>It was cool, I was involved in a lot of biotech stuff that (at the time) was way over my head, and got to be there for their first FDA drug approval.</p>
