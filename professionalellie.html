               <h3>REVERSING HOPELESSNESS: AUDIO TECH AND CO-HOST</h3>
               <p>I'm also volunteering part-time for a nonprofit called Reversing Hopelessness. I own the tech operations (recording, audio tech, etc) and co-host a podcast 
                  series where we discuss large topics related to mental health. This is a new project and backend work is still in progress, so I'll update when these projects launch!

                <h3>KEURIG DR PEPPER: CDI RESEARCH CO-OP</h3>
                <p>My last co-op was on Keurig Dr Pepper's product design team in Chicago! I did UI/UX focused stuff with our brewers (not super involved in the Dr Pepper part).</p>
                <p>I performed tests on existing brewer models, analyzed/compiled data to understand user journeys, and recommended design improvements for new, upcoming brewers.</p>
                <p>I also led / observed consumer testing focus groups on new products, new designs, and general sentiments about smart tech and AI, compiling data and findings into reports
                    and recommendations.
                <p>One project I worked on was developing a UI database of all exisitng Keurig brewers. This was a cross-team project where
                  I performed a sweep of our existing brewer models, categorized them, and collaborated with our design, research, and engineering teams to refine the resource.

                <h3>TULIP INTERFACES: TULIP EXPERIENCE CENTER CO-OP</h3>
                <p>My second co-op was at <a href="https://tulip.co" target="_blank">Tulip Interfaces</a> as an engineering co-op. I did a little bit of everything and got really comfortable with the Tulip ecosystem.</p>
                <p>I also helped develop, set-up, and support the creation of demos for our various tech conferences, such as <a href="https://tulip.co/ebooks/40-hour-pop-up-factory-2023/" target="_blank">the Pop Up Factory I set up for Autodesk and Formlabs's Digital Factory</a>.</p>

                <p>This job had a lot of misc. solutions engineering and a tech stack that changed with the weather. 
                    I played with FIDO2/Microsoft Azure for a project with our tech partners at Nymi. I built out some widgets for Kolver in d3 and chart.js. I maintained uptime for the 
                    <a href="https://tulip.co/tulip-experience-center/">TEC</a>, which involved all sorts of things-- Node RED, computer vision, Quantum RTLS 2.0, robotics, lasers, etc. </p>
                <p>To see an example of a project I worked on, check out <a href="https://library.tulip.co/videos/onshape-integration-example">this</a> demo I built to
                  showcase Tulip's functionality with the <a href="https://www.onshape.com/en/">Onshape API</a>.

               <h3>FUNDAMENTALS OF NETWORKS: TEACHING ASSISTANT</h3>
               <p>I was a course assistant for EECE2540, Fundamentals of Networks, under Prof. Stefano Basagni
                  and Prof. Elena Mor. This course provides an overview of modern communication networks. I was grading, answering questions, helping out with homeworks
                  and the final Python assignment. It was neat.

                <h3>SERES THERAPEUTICS: FEV AND AUTOMATION CO-OP</h3>
                <p>My first co-op was at <a href="https://www.serestherapeutics.com" target="_blank">Seres Therapeutics</a> as a validation and automation engineer. This was extended to a part-time position so I ended up working there for a year.</p>
                <p>On the FEV (facilities, engineering, validation) team, I performed document validation and facilities maintenance in a GxP facility. This involved cleanroom inspections,
                    equipment documentation, and database management.
                </p>
                <p>During my part-time work, I joined the automation team for the Hanwell EMS systems project. This project focused on advancing and improving the EMS systems in our three R&D and manufacturing facilities. 
                    Since I was there for phase 1 of a three-year project, I mainly helped lay the groundwork for the integration planned in later phases. This work included:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Evaluating current sensors and designing UIs for lighting, HVAC, and security systems.</li>
                        <li>Standardizing communication protocols for wired sensors.</li>
                        <li>Exploring and identifying opportunities for new control methods in our existing hardware, focusing on trend monitoring.</li>
                    </ul>
