          <h2 class="description">during covid, i drew a few college commitment group photos, since we couldn't take photos with each other in-person. taking photos with your friend group, with everyone wearing their college gear, was a big deal and always a lot of fun. so this was just a way of trying to capture that same feeling while social-distancing.  </h2>
