        <h2 class="text">during covid, i was commissioned to do a bunch of these quick doodles of friend groups. a big tradition at my school,
        and others i assume, was to have a day where you and your friends all wore college gear and took photos together. since we were on lockdown,
        we obviously couldn't do that, so i drew those photos instead to kinda capture the same feeling. idk </h2>
