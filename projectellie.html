                <h3>CHIPLET: SENIOR CAPSTONE</h3>
                <p>Imagine a tool like Scratch, but instead of teaching programming concepts, it teaches the fundamentals
                    of computer engineering-- enabling students to play with digital logic, building from a simple nand gate to a fully functioning RISC-V processor.
                    We developed a modular, hands-on system called Chiplet that aims to accomplish this.

                <h3>NOTE.ABLE (WIP)</h3>
                <p>I've always wanted to make a social media app that allows users to annotate playlists. Being able to
                    curate a playlist for a loved one and leave personalized notes explaining each song's significance, or just leave notes 
                    on songs for your personal reference (recounting a memory, a remark about a song's sample, etc). I was able to work on the 
                    database for this project in my CS3200 Intro to Databases class, but have been continuously developing the rest of it on my own time.
                    Tech stack at the moment is React, Node.js, and MySQL.

                <h3>FPGA SOBEL ALGORITHM</h3>
                <p>This was my final project for EECE4632, Hardware-Software Codesign for FPGA-Based Systems. Using a PYNQ-Z2 FPGA, Vitis HLS and Vivado,
                    I built out a Sobel edge detection algorithm using hardware resources that was slightly more efficient than its software companion. Check 
                    out the final presentation <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lfTy_vV2xIO_6-ie4df6nmfVEf5jk7bRoHKVyXSpXrQ/edit?usp=sharing">here,</a>
                    and reach out to me to request any code samples.

                <h3>OVERCODE</h3>
                <p>This was the final project for CS4530, Software Engineering. Working with a team of four and an Agile approach,
                    we modified the starter code base of Fake Stack Overflow and created OverCode-- a collaborative coding platform
                    that allows users to create leetcode-style coding problems, collaborate in real-time, and compete against all users
                    on global leaderboards. Built with React and MongoDB, the platform features secure code execution for testing and performance profiling.

                <p><a href="https://generatenu.com/">Generate</a> is Northeastern's student-led product studio. Our team was building for Alia, a Shopify plugin that
                    enabled vendors to create loyalty programs-- customers could take a quiz to learn about the business and earn coupon codes in exchange.
                    Our tech stack included TypeScript, React, Node.js and PostgreSQL with GraphQL.

                <h3>A COMIC COLLECTION... (SUPER WIP)</h3>
                <p>I had a short comic strip in high school called "Vague Comics." Since then, I've had the idea of wanting to develop a full fledged
                    comic series. I've always been drawn to essay series or anthologies so it'd probably be something like that. I'll add a blog here someday to 
                    update this project.

                <h3>MENTAL HEALTH OUTREACH (WIP)</h3>
                <p>I have an ongoing project focused on advocating for mental health resources and education. There are a few things brewing,
                    but for now here's an article I wrote for the Huntington News <a href="https://huntnewsnu.com/80655/editorial/op-ed-northeastern-switched-mental-health-provider-networks-i-almost-lost-my-therapist/"
