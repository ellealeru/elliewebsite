                <h3>CHIPLET: SENIOR CAPSTONE</h3>
                <p>Imagine a tool like Scratch, but instead of teaching programming concepts, it teaches the fundamentals
                    of computer engineering-- enabling students to play with digital logic, building from a simple nand gate to a fully functioning RISC-V processor.
                    We developed a modular, hands-on system called Chiplet that aims to accomplish this.

                <h3>NOTE.ABLE (WIP)</h3>
                <p>I've always wanted to make a social media app that allows users to annotate playlists. Being able to
                    curate a playlist for a loved one and leave personalized notes explaining each song's significance, or just leave notes 
                    on songs for your personal reference (recounting a memory, a remark about a song's sample, etc). I was able to work on the 
                    database for this project in my CS3200 Intro to Databases class, but have been continuously developing the rest of it on my own time.

                <h3>MENTAL HEALTH OUTREACH (WIP)</h3>
                <p>I have an ongoing project focused on advocating for mental health resources and education. There are a few things brewing,
                    but for now here's an article I wrote for the Huntington News <a href="https://huntnewsnu.com/80655/editorial/op-ed-northeastern-switched-mental-health-provider-networks-i-almost-lost-my-therapist/"
                    target="_blank">targeting the university's inadequate mental health resources.</a>
